# <p align="center">Investigating and Optimising Machine Learning Algorithms for Heart Disease</p>

<b>Problem Definition: - </b>This project is specifically targeting the people of all age group who are suffering from Heart problem. This project will be given a set of patient characteristics such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical history, the goal is to predict whether a patient is at risk of developing heart disease. This prediction is based on a variety of factors, including patient’s lifestyle, habits, diet, exercise and other medical conditions that may increase their risk of heart disease.

<b>Aims and Objectives: - </b>The aim of a heart disease prediction project would be to develop four different model  that can accurately predict the risk of heart disease in patients based on their characteristics and medical history. This prediction can be used to identify those patients who are at high risk of developing heart disease and can be prevent by reducing the risks.
The ultimate goal of this project is to analyse the difference between the algorithms that can predict more accurate results with which this can improve the prevention and management of heart disease, which is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.
1.	Tools and technologies that will be used to build this project is R programming.
2.	Machine Learning Model that will be used in this project are: -	<b>Linear Regression, Neural Network, Support Vector, Naïve Bayes</b>

<b>Background Sources: - </b>Heart disease is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and it can affect people of all ages. Heart disease is also known as cardiovascular disease. It is a term used to describe a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. Risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle.<br>
There are several signs and symptoms that can cause a heart attack like:
1.	Chest pain which is the most common symptom of a heart attack, and it may feel like a squeezing, pressure, or pain in the center of the chest.
2.	Some people may experience discomfort or pain in the arms, neck, jaw, or back during a heart attack.
3.	Difficulty in breathing, or the feeling of being short of breath, can be a sign of a heart attack.
4.	Some people start sweating on their entire body during a heart attack.
5.	During the heart attack people start feeling dizzy or lightheaded.

Before development of this project I had researched about some similar project, I found the most of the individuals had developed the heart disease prediction but they had used only one algorithm to trained the classifier however I am using four different machine learning algorithms, also I will find the accuracy which algorithms works faster, this functionality make my project different from others. 

<b>Approach: -</b>This project goes with RAD methodology because this project can be developed faster and of higher quality. Each phase this project brings highest priority functionality and changes are flexible during development.<br><br>
Steps to achieve the goal:-
1. Gathering information related to heart disease on patients and collecting dataset which may come from electronic health records, clinical trials or population-based studies. Create the tasks that is to clean and pre-process the data to ensure that it is suitable for analysis.
2. Explore the data to gain a better understanding. This may involve visualizing the data using plots and charts.
3. Use machine learning techniques to test and train the data to develop 4 different model on Linear regression, Neural Network, Support Vector and Naïve Bayes. Compare the algorithms to analyse which algorithm can predict more accurately on heart disease.
4. Based on the results, need to refine and improve the model by adjusting the algorithm or by adding additional data. Repeat this process until the developed model will meets the specific goals. 

<b>Evaluation: -<b>In order to receive feedback, this project will run towards the different groups of people
with different age gaps between them.
